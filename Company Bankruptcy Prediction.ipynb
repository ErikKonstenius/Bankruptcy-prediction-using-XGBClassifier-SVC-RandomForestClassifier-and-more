    "The results show that boosting algorithms such as CatBoost and XGBoost outperform other methods used in this project. The main idea of boosting is to sequentially combine many weak models (a model performing slightly better than random chance) and thus through greedy search create a strong competitive predictive model. Because gradient boosting fits the decision trees sequentially, the fitted trees will learn from the mistakes of former trees and hence reduce the errors. Although the prediction scores are very similar, XGBoost does achieve the highest precision of about 40 %. This score is among the highest on Kaggle. "
